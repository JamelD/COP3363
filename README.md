### Assignments
> ***Note:*** Some homework descriptions may be missing information. I did not archive the homework descriptions like I archived my homework submissions. Two years later, I wanted to add this to my portfolio, so having a whole grasp of the assignments is imperative. I was able to find archives of the homework descriptions for some of the homework assignments, but others may be derived based on my homework submissions and some other information.

*Assignment Links:*
1. [Homework1 README.md](Homework1/README.md "My Homework1 README.md file")
    - To practice with writing a small C++ main() program, along with compiling and running it
    - To practice with basic C++ input/output features, along with some simple decimal formatting
    - To practice with basic arithmetic operators in C++

2. [Homework2 README.md](Homework2/README.md "My Homework2 README.md file")
    - This assignment will consist of writing a program that gives practice with basic selection statements (if,else,switch), as well as further practice with basic I/O, and output formatting.
    - Real world application, this program will help you calculate your overall course grade at the end of the class if done correctly :)

3. [Homework3 README.md](Homework3/README.md "My Homework3 README.md file")
    - This assignment consists of writing code that involves practice utilizing loops and writing and calling functions.

4. [Homework4 README.md](Homework4/README.md "My Homework4 README.md file")
    - This assignment will consist of writing a couple functions and allowing the student to gain practice and understanding of random number generation, and general coding skills dealing with functions, loops, and conditionals

5. [Homework5 README.md](Homework5/README.md "My Homework5 README.md file")
    - To gain practice with arrays and common array algorithms, as well as the use of array parameters in functions.

6. [Homework6 README.md](Homework6/README.md "My Homework6 README.md file")
    - This assignment will involve practice with either C-style strings or string objects, as well as some of the libraries that involve manipulations on characters (like cctype) and strings (cstring/string).

7. [Homework7 README.md](Homework7/README.md "My Homework7 README.md file")
    - To gain experience with using an array of structures, as well as with dynamic allocation of an array. This program provides further practice in file input, strings (either c-strings or string objects, programmer's choice), function building, if statements/switch, loops, and general code task problem solving and layout.
